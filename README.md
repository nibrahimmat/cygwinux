INTRODUCTION

What is cygWinux?

cygWinux is a cygwin distro that does not require a time -consuming installation of cy.gwin
cygWinux is a computer program like an OS distro that needs to be installed into Windows like a traditional application so that you can use it with you on a mobile device or drive and use it like a Windows program. When a USB flash drive, portable hard drive, or other mobile device is installed or your cloud drive is synced, you have access to your software and personal data just as you do on your own PC. And when you unplug the device, no personal data is left behind.

No Special Hardware - Use USB flash drives, portable hard drives, etc.
No Extra Software - Just download, run the installer and go
Hard to believe - It's that easy

REQUIREMENTS
------------
cygwinux is a full 64 bit Cygwin distro

Address space is a very limiting factor for Cygwin. These days, a full 32 bit Cygwin distro is not feasible anymore, and will in all likelihood fail in random places due to an issue with the fork(2) system call.

Therefore cygwin tean recommend using 32 bit Cygwin only in limited scenarios, with only a minimum of necessary packages installed, and only if there's no way to run 64 bit Cygwin instead.
